The ReplayFX App is the perfect companion for anyone attending the annual Replay Foundation Expo in Pittsburgh on July 27-30, 2017. The four-day conference will feature more than 750 arcade and pinball machines, over 2,000 retro console games, tabletop games, a showcase of new products by game developers, competitions offering over $110,000 in prize money, movies, seminars, magicians, live musicians, balloon artists, face-painters, and more.

With so many events and attractions, we thought it might be useful to provide an easily accessible app for viewing the entire four-day schedule. In addition to viewing the full schedule, users may also choose to view events by their type: games, competitions, movies, live music, and seminars. Users can add their favorite events from any of these views to a personal schedule, allowing them to prioritize concurrent events and design their optimal ReplayFX experience.

This code is for the web interface which allows organizers to manage the app, including adding and changing scheduled events. It was written and designed by John Lange and Mandy Kendall.


#Development

The ReplayFX Web Interface was created as part of the second session of Academy Pittsburgh.  The back end was initially mob-programmed at a build night at Looking for Group, and was later refined by Mandy Kendall and John Lange.  It is written in C# / MVC with Entity Framework, and the front end was built utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.
